# SPY500_Py-Tableau
This project was to show my capability with tableau by using some python in the background to acquire the SPY data from Yahoo's web page.
Once the data was web scraped on a csv then I used tableau to visualize the data. The dashboard shows quite a few points showing how low the trading volume has decreased, the price hasn't increased as much as before and the forecast only shows a small potential gain assuming the market acts the same as it has been prior to that date.
CSV and Python code attached. ADDITIONALLY, the python File ALSO has chart that simulates a Monte carlo of the data under the red comment saying Monte Carlo Simulation.
